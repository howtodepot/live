_Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first and lessons afterwards_  - Vernon Law

There is no substitute for first hand experience. In this blog, I plan to share all that, hopefully it  will help you avoid mistakes and also make you smarter, along the way.  

I arrived in America as an immigrant with nothing in my pocket but lots of hope. Over the years I have tried to constantly educate myself and have managed to make a decent living. 

I have followed [Warren buffet's] [buffet wikiperidia link] philosophy to save first and spent, what is left over. This advise has served me well. As you follow this blog, you will find that advise sprinkled all over. Most visibly in my DIY approaches to things...

## Blog Structure
I will primarily share financial, parenting and home ownership tips on this blog. Most of the blog posts will be categorized as such. You can get to these quickly by clicking the [categories link] [categories link] at the top. 

English is not my first language and I never had any formal learning in journalism or writing. Most of my English writing skill is acquired over the years. The information I will share will make up - hopefully - for my lack of formal journalism education. 

My promise - I will share whatever I have learned. At times, I will also share information about off topcis...  but if its tagged as a DIY ... than - be assured - that I have done it first hand and therefore I am sharing it.  

I will also be not writing frequently.I strongly believe that the information presented,should have some value for my readers. I don't believe in wasting your time if its not worth it for you. 

## Disclaimer

I am not a financial advisor nor am I an expert in anything. What I am sharing here is in good faith and never a substitute for expert qualified advise  - from professionals in the trade.

Please DOUBLE CHECK anything that you try to attempt after reading my posts. 

I hope you will enjoy reading these posts as I will keep it simple and on point.

Thank you for reading.
